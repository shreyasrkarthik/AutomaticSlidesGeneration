They occupy about seven per cent of the earth's land surface and harbours more than half of the world’s plants and animals. Found in the Tropics (23.5° N - 23.5° S) hence called Tropical. Evergreen, means that they do not shed leaves seasonally like Deciduous trees that they are always green.

The trees are evergreen as there is no period of drought. Here the trees are 60m in height and the rainfall is between 15 cm to 30 cm. They are of hardwood type. Leaves are broad and give out excess water through evapo-transpiration. <marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="block"/> Vegetation Ebony, mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona are some of the commercially important trees found in these forests.
